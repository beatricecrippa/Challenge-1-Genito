# Challenge-1
Here I have uploaded my solution for the first Challenge of the Advanced Programming and Scientific Computing (PACS) course in Politecnico di Milano.
The main purpose of the challenge is to implement a program which computes the minimum of a function of n variables using the **gradient method**.
In particular, this method is combined with a precise rule to find out the decay parameter, chosen by the user between the Exponential Decay ($'\α_k=α_0*exp(-μ*k)\'
