# Challenge-1

## Abstract
Here I have uploaded my solution for the first Challenge of the Advanced Programming and Scientific Computing (PACS) course in Politecnico di Milano.
The main purpose of the challenge is to implement a program which computes the minimum of a function of n variables using the **gradient method**.
In particular, this method is combined with a precise rule to find out the decay parameter, chosen by the user between the Exponential Decay, the Inverse Decay or an Approximation Line Search (which in our case was implemented using the Armijo rule) (see more informations on the Challenge23-24-1.pdf file).

## Rules
In order to execute the program correctly, it is compulsory to change correctly in the 'Makefile' section the path where to include the muParser library. In particular,
